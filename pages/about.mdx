# About Scrapbook

As a [Hack Clubber](https://hackclub.com/), you are always learning and building things. Scrapbook was made by the Hack Club community because many of us have found that **showing up every day** has been key to our success in learning. Even if we didn’t make something big or impressive, showing up consistently and making _something_ was key.

Scrapbook helps you **share those things you're working on** with the rest of the Hack Club community, and keeps you motivated by recording each day you contribute, tallying up your contribution streak to show on your profile.

## How do I join?

Your Scrapbook is automatically generated for you when you make your first Scrapbook post. In order to post, you'll need to [join the Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack). Once you've completed the onboarding flow in Slack and have access to all of the channels, join the `#scrapbook` channel. From here, Scrapbook posts are automatically generated for you when you post a message in the `#scrapbook` channel.

A post requires just two things: a description and an image. Your image can be dragged straight into Slack and Scrapbook will take care of the rest. [An example message](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1646030307450419) into Slack might look like:

```
learned Express generator today - now back to a ton of (organized) files
```

_Example pulled from [audreyolafz's scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/audreyolafz)_

Here's how it would look on Slack to create a post:

## Scrappy (the Slack Bot)

Scrappy, our handy dandy [Slack bot](https://github.com/hackclub/scrappy), not only handles the automatic generation of things, but provides some helpful commands as well. These commands are also documented in our Slack if you send the message `/scrappy` in any channel.

<details>
  <summary>Available commands</summary>

  - `/scrappy-togglestreaks`: toggles your streak count on/off in your status
  - `/scrappy-togglestreaks all`: opts out of streaks completely
  - `/scrappy-open`: opens your Scrapbook (or another user's if you specify a username)
  - `/scrappy-setcss`: adds a custom CSS file to your Scrapbook profile. [Check out this cool example](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/msw)!
  - `/scrappy-setdomain`: links a custom domain to your Scrapbook profile, e.g. [scrapbook.maggieliu.dev](https://scrapbook.maggieliu.dev/)
  - `/scrappy-setusername`: change your profile username
  - `/scrappy-setaudio`: links an audio file to your Scrapbook. [See an example here](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/matthew)!
  - `/scrappy-setwebhook`: create a Scrappy Webhook we will make a blank fetch request to this URL every time you post
  - `/scrappy-webring`: adds or removes someone to your webring
  - *Remove* a post: delete the Slack message and Scrappy will automatically update for you
  - *Edit* a post: edit the Slack message and it will automatically update for you
  - *Post* to the `#scrapbook` channel or add an existing Slack message to Scrapbook by reacting to it with the `:scrappy:` emoji (Note: If it isn't working, make sure Scrappy is added to the channel by mentioning `@scrappy`)
</details>

## Custom domains

To put your profile on your own domain, run `/scrappy setdomain <domain>` in Slack, giving your website’s hostname (e.g. [`scrapbook.maggieliu.dev`](https://scrapbook.maggieliu.dev/)). Then, add a `CNAME` record on your DNS provider, pointed to `cname.vercel-dns.com`. If you’re curious how this works, it’s [open source right here](http://github.com/hackclub/summer-domains).

Hack Clubbers can also use a `dino.icu` subdomain by submitting a PR to our [DNS repository](https://github.com/hackclub/dns).
  
## CSS customization

To customize the CSS on your profile page, run `/scrappy-setcss <link>` in Slack, giving a link to a CSS file or a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com). [Here’s the default CSS](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/themes/default.css), for your overwriting pleasure.

Want to preview your CSS before adding it to your profile? Check out <Mention username="jasonaa" />’s [Scrapbook Customizer](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/customizer).

If you are a beginner at coding and need a more in depth guide on how to work with CSS, check out [@sampoder](https://github.com/sampoder)’s workshop on the topic, this covers different useful areas like CSS variables, fonts and making custom animations. You can access it from [here](https://workshops.hackclub.com/scrapbook_css/).
  
### Colors & fonts

If you’d like to change the page-wide fonts or colors, you can change yours with [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables). Here’s the values the site uses by default:

<details>

  <summary>Default values</summary>

```css
:root {
  --colors-pink: #ff62dc;
  --colors-orange: #ff5b00;
  --colors-yellow: #f7ff00;
  --colors-green: #28ff00;
  --colors-cyan: #00ffff;
  --colors-blue: #00a4ff;
  --colors-purple: #c210ff;

  --colors-darker: #151613;
  --colors-dark: #20201d;
  --colors-darkless: #2b2b27;
  --colors-black: #1d201d;
  --colors-slate: #3b413a;
  --colors-muted: #777f76;
  --colors-smoke: #d5d8d5;
  --colors-snow: #f5f5f4;
  --colors-white: #ffffff;

  --fonts-body: 'Baloo 2', system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',
    Roboto, sans-serif;
  --fonts-display: 'Shrikhand', system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',
    Roboto, sans-serif;
  --fonts-mono: 'SF Mono', 'Roboto Mono', Menlo, Consolas, monospace;
}
```

Some “relative” colors use these colors for various components:

- `--colors-background` – page background color
- `--colors-text` – page text color
- `--colors-elevated` – “elevated” content, like the posts
- `--colors-sunken` – “sunken” content
- `--colors-progress` – the color of the progress bar

</details>

Our dark mode is powered by [`prefers-color-scheme: dark`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

## Website widget

Want to showcase your streak on your personal website? We’ve created a small widget that you can put on your website with two lines of code. It shows up in the bottom right corner. Just replace `username` with your Scrappy username. Here’s the code snippet:

```html
<script src="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/scrapbookwidget.js"></script>
<script>displayScrapbookUsername('username')</script>
```

If you have a custom domain, you can optionally link the scrapbook widget to it! Do it like this:

```html
<script src="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/scrapbookwidget.js"></script>
<script>displayScrapbookUsername('username', 'https://scrapbook.example.com')</script>
```

## RSS feed

Want to get an RSS feed of your Scrapbook posts? Just append `.rss` to the end of your Scrapbook profile's URL, like so: https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/(username).rss

## macOS app

Hack Clubbers using a Mac can post directly from their menu bar using Scrapple, an app built by <Mention username="linus" />! From the menu bar, type in the update, select the attachments for the post and send it off into the interweb…

You can [download the app here](https://github.com/LinusSkucas/Scrapple), and check out the [open source code here](https://github.com/LinusSkucas/Scrapple).

To install using Homebrew Cask:

```
brew tap LinusSkucas/homebrew-taps
brew install --cask scrapple
```

## Public API

This site exposes a public JSON API powered by [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) that formats data in a useful way. The live site runs entirely on this API.

- [`/api/posts`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/api/posts) – Get all posts (used on the homepage)
- [`/api/users`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/api/users) – Get all users
- [`/api/users/:username`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/api/users/zrl) – Get a specific user’s profile + posts
- [`/api/users/:username/mentions`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/api/users/sampoder/mentions) – Get a specific user’s mentions
- [`/api/r/:emoji`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/api/r/hardware) – Get all posts tagged with a specific emoji
- [`/:username.png`](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/sampoder.png) – Get a user's avatar as an image URL

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged and welcome! There are two GitHub repositories that contain code for Scrapbook: the [Scrapbook website](https://github.com/hackclub/scrapbook#contributing) and [Scrappy the Slack bot](https://github.com/hackclub/scrappy#contributing). Each repository has a section on contributing guidelines and how to run each project locally.

Development chatter happens in the [#scrapbook-dev](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C035D6S6TFW) channel in the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/).

## How does it all work underneath?

Behind the scenes, the site runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), React.js, & [SWR](https://swr.now.sh) for data fetching. All pages are [static-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Videos are hosted by [Mux](https://mux.com). The custom domains use a [Vercel serverless function](https://github.com/hackclub/summer-domains). The [Slack integration](https://github.com/hackclub/scrappy) runs on [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). All the data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database, fetched using [Prisma](https://prisma.io).

## The Origin of Scrapbook

Scrapbook was originally built in a week while preparing for the 2020 [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/). To support makers, Hack Club distributed $50,000 in free electronics to 28 different countries. Scrapbook was made to help Hack Clubbers showcase the things they were doing during this event, but grew into a tool that the community uses every single day.
