      Woweee!!! What's that??? That file is so big...I don't have enough memory for it...

      Since I can't download this file, I'm going to make it "public" via Slack's API and upload it to your scrapbook that way. The update will be live on your scrapbook in 30 seconds, but it'll take anywhere between 30 seconds and a few minutes for it to be viewable. I'll notify you when it's ready.

      (PS: You may receive a notification from Slackbot—go ahead and ignore it.)
    imagefail: |
      Hmmmmm :thonkspin: I couldn't fetch your image for some reason. I'm going to try to upload your image another way. You may receive a DM from Slackbot—go ahead and ignore it. If you don't see your image live on your Scrapbook, please let <@U4QAK9SRW> know.
    zach: Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just tried to update your streak, but <@U4QAK9SRW> reinstalled me with his Slack tokens at some point, so it didn\'t work. When you get a chance, reinstall me with your tokens and update the env variables in the Heroku deployment. Then toggle \`/scrappy displaystreaks\` off and on again.
